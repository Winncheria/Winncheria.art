                The first lily of June opens its red mouth. <br>
                All over the sand road where we walk <br>
                multiflora rose climbs trees cascading <br>
                white or pink blossoms, simple, intense <br>
                the scene drifting like colored mist.<br> <br>

                The arrowhead is spreading its creamy <br>
                clumps of flower and the blackberries <br>
                are blooming in the thickets. Season of <br>
                joy for the bee. The green will never <br>
                again be so green, so purely and lushly <br> <br>

                new, grass lifting its wheaty seedheads <br>
                into the wind. Rich fresh wine <br>
                of June, we stagger into you smeared <br>
                with pollen, overcome as the turtle <br>
                laying her eggs in roadside sand. <br>
